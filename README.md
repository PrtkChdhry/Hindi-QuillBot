The "Hindi Quillbot for Paraphrasing and Grammar Check" project is an innovative solution designed to enhance written content in the Hindi language by leveraging state-of-the-art Natural Language Processing (NLP)
techniques. This web-based application performs paraphrasing and grammar correction using advanced machine learning models. The system is built using a Flask framework and integrates Hugging Face models for 
paraphrasing and grammar correction, and Sentence Transformer for semantic similarity validation. 
Key features include the ability to evaluate the accuracy of processed text through cosine similarity, n-gram analysis, and word count metrics, ensuring both semantic integrity and linguistic improvement. By 
combining deep learning-based NLP frameworks with a user friendly interface, this tool empowers users to produce polished Hindi text with improved grammar and phrasing. The project aims to bridge the gap in 
high-quality Hindi language text processing, making it an invaluable tool for students, professionals, and content creators in Hindi-speaking communities.
